        <p> My hobby is singing songs and I love to sing during my free time. Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists </p>

        <p> Taylor Alison Swift born on December 13, 1989 is an American singer-songwriter. Her narrative lyricism, which often takes inspiration from her personal life and experiences, has received widespread critical praise and media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 2004, to pursue a career in country music. She broke into the country music scene with her eponymous debut studio album in 2006, which included the singles "Teardrops on My Guitar" and "Our Song". Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her second studio album, Fearless in 2008, a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now in 2010, blended country-pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles "Mine" and "Back to December".</p>
